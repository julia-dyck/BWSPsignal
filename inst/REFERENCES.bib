  abstract = {Pharmacovigilance is the process of monitoring the emergence of harm from a 
      medicine once it has been licensed and is in use. The aim is to identify new 
      adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or changes in frequency of known ADRs. The last 
      decade has seen increased interest for the use of electronic health records 
      (EHRs) in pharmacovigilance. The causal mechanism of an ADR will often result in 
      the occurrence being time dependent. We propose identifying signals for ADRs 
      based on detecting a variation in hazard of an event using a time-to-event 
      approach. Cornelius et al. proposed a method based on the Weibull Shape Parameter 
      (WSP) and demonstrated this to have optimal performance for ADRs occurring 
      shortly after taking treatment or delayed ADRs, and introduced censoring at 
      varying time points to increase performance for intermediate ADRs. We now propose 
      two new approaches which combined perform equally well across all time periods. 
      The performance of this new approach is illustrated through an EHR 
      Bisphosphonates dataset and a simulation study. One new approach is based on the 
      power generalised Weibull distribution (pWSP) introduced by Bagdonavicius and 
      Nikulin alongside an extended version of the WSP test, which includes one 
      censored dataset resulting in improved detection across time period (dWSP). In 
      the Bisphosphonates example, the pWSP and dWSP tests correctly signalled two 
      known ADRs, and signal one adverse event for which no evidence of association 
      with the drug exist. A combined test involving both pWSP and dWSP is reliable 
      independently of the time of occurrence of ADRs.},

    abstract = { This article explains a decision rule that uses Bayesian posterior distributions as the basis for accepting or rejecting null values of parameters. This decision rule focuses on the range of plausible values indicated by the highest density interval of the posterior distribution and the relation between this range and a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) around the null value. The article also discusses considerations for setting the limits of a ROPE and emphasizes that analogous considerations apply to setting the decision thresholds for p values and Bayes factors. }
