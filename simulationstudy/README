## Overview

This folder contains the R scripts necessary to reproduce the simulation study evaluating the `BPgWSP test` presented in the article

## Background

The `bwsp_test()` function, implemented in the `BWSPsignal` package, is designed to conduct a signal detection test for adverse drug reactions based on electronic
health records data. Our simulation study aims to evaluate/tune its effectiveness under various scenarios. The results are currently available as a preprint on [preprint server name], accessible at: [link to preprint].


## Structure of the Repository

The repository contains the following key components:

- `masterfile.R` – The main script that orchestrates the execution of all
   necessary R scripts in the correct order.


## How to Reproduce the Simulation Study

Open the `masterfile.R` script in R and open all scripts by running the `edit.file()` commands to sequentially make adjustments (note remarks) and execute all necessary steps to run and evaluate the simulations.
