## Overview

This folder contains the R scripts necessary to reproduce the simulation study evaluating the `BPgWSP test` presented in the article

[add arxiv preprint ref here].


## Background

The `bwsp_test()` function, implemented in the `BWSPsignal` package, is designed to conduct a signal detection test for adverse drug reactions based on electronic
health records data. Our simulation study aims to evaluate/tune its effectiveness under various scenarios. The results are currently available as a preprint on [preprint server name], accessible at: [link to preprint].


## Structure of the Repository

The repository contains the following key components:

- `masterfile.R` – The main script that orchestrates the execution of all
   necessary R scripts in the correct order.
-  `run_[...].R` – scripts to run the simulation and save the output of each 
   repetition in results raw folder
- `eval_[...].R` – scripts for evaluating the BPgWSP test given the results of 
   the simulation study


## How to Reproduce the Simulation Study

Open the `masterfile.R` script in R and open all scripts by running the `edit.file()` commands to sequentially adjust working directories and execute all necessary steps to run and evaluate the simulations.
