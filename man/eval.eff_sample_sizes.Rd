\title{Evaluate effective sample sizes by tte and prior distribution}
\usage{
eval.eff_sample_sizes(pc_list, threshold = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{pc_list}{list containing simulation parameters (see \code{\link{sim.setup_simpars}})}

\item{threshold}{numeric threshold for acceptable effective sample size (default: 10000 as recommended by Kruschke, 2015)}
}
\value{
list with summary statistics (\verb{$summary}), a ggplot2 object (\verb{$plot}),
and the cleaned data (\verb{$df}) used for both.
}
\description{
Summarizes and visualizes effective sample sizes of the stan models fitted during
the simulation study, grouped by time-to-event (tte) and prior distribution types.
This helps assess which of the tte and prior distribution choices can be expected
to be sufficient for HDI+ROPE testing, along with other diagnostics such as
\code{\link{eval.non_conv_cases}} and \code{\link{eval.ex_times}}.
