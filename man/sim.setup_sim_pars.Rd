\arguments{
\item{N}{A scalar or vector of sample sizes.}

\item{br}{A scalar or vector of background rates.}

\item{post.ci.type}{A character string indicating whether to extract equal tailed
intervals (\code{"ETI"}) or highest posterior density intervals (\code{HDI}) as
credibilty interval/region for BWSP testing (see \link{bwsp_test}).}

\item{cred.level}{A scalar or vector of credibility levels to be tried for construction
of region of practical equivalence (ROPE) and posterior credibility interval (CI).}

\item{reps}{The number of repetitions for each simulation scenario.}

\item{batch.size}{The number of simulation repetitions to be saved in a batch}

\item{batch.nr}{per default \code{reps/batch.size}; the number of batch files
in resultpath.}

\item{resultpath}{The directory where intermediate results of the simulation
are saved.}

\item{stanmod.chains}{The number of Markov chains to run.}

\description{
With one partly interactive function
data generation, model fitting, number of simulation runs and evaluation are
set up and gathered in a parameter combination (pc) list, from which the
information are called in following steps of a simulation study.
}
\details{
The tuning parameters are used to evaluate the performance of different BWSP
signal detection tests applied to data scenarios of interest.
The set of tuning parameters consisting of the choice of the
\enumerate{
\item distribution chosen for the tte model, must be a subset out of "w", "dw"
and pgw",
\item specification of prior means and standard deviations to reflect the
prior belief about an expected event time toward the beginning/1st quarter,
middle/2nd quarter or end/3rd quarter of the study period,
prior distribution chosen for scale and shape parameters, must be a subset
out of "fgg", "ggg", "fll" and "lll",
\item type of posterior credible interval, must be a subset out of "ETI"
(equal-tailed interval) and "HDI" (highest density interval).
}

Batch saving is done to prevent losing simulation results in case of an
interuption of simulation.
