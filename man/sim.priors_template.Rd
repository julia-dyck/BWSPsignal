\title{Template for prior specification in simulation study}
\usage{
sim.priors_template(tte.dist = c("w", "dw", "pgw"), prior.sds = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tte.dist}{character vector specifying one or multiple modelling approaches; options are
\code{"w", "dw", "pgw"} (see \code{\link{bwsp_model}})}

\item{prior.sds}{numeric value setting the same prior sd for all scale
and shape parameters across all included model types. Defaults to \code{NULL},
leaving all sd fields as \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A named list containing three data frames
\code{$w}, \code{$dw}, and \code{$pgw}.
Each is a data frame specifying prior beliefs and placeholder entries for prior means and sds.
}
\description{
Generates a structured template for specifying prior means and prior standard
deviations (sds) for the Weibull, double Weibull, or Power generalized Weibull
(PgW) model parameters to be inserted into \code{\link{sim.setup_sim_pars}}.
}
\details{
The returned list contains one data frame per time-to-event distribution
(\code{w}, \code{dw}, \code{pgw}).
For each chosen tte distribution, rows corresponding to
different levels of prior belief about the the hazard function are provided, namely
\code{"none"}, \code{"beginning"}, \code{"middle"}, and \code{"end"}
\insertCite{dyck2024bpgwsppreprint}{BWSPsignal}.
Given the template, prior means and sds must be filled by the user before simulation.

\examples{
####  prior elicitation --------------------------------------------------------
# try a few prior parameter combinations and see whether the resulting hazard 
# roughly matches the prior belief about the hazard form 

# Expected event time can also be taken into account for some guidance, but 
# should not be prioritized.
# The reason is that we do not expect the model to accurately fit the hazard of the 
# data, but only catch the rough form by distinguishing the cases
# constant vs decreasing vs unimodal vs increasing hazard.

# set prior means for Power generalized Weibull parameters:
plot_pgw(scale = 1, shape = 1, powershape = 1)     # under prior belief "none"
plot_pgw(scale = 20, shape = 5.5, powershape = 14) # under prior belief "beginning"
plot_pgw(scale = 180, shape = 1, powershape = 1)   # under prior belief "middle"
plot_pgw(scale = 300, shape = 4, powershape = 1)   # under prior belief "end"


#### specify parameter combinations for simulation study -----------------------

fp_list = sim.priors_template(tte.dist = c("pgw"),
                              prior.sds = 10) # setup prior template
# fill in prior template with values chosen in prior elicitation
fp_list$pgw[,2] = c(1, 1, 20, 300)   # scale prior means
fp_list$pgw$shape.mean_pgw <- c(1, 0.207, 5.5, 4) # shape prior means
fp_list$pgw[,6] = c(1, 1, 14, 1)     # powershape prior means

fp_list # filled fitpars.list ready for sim.setup_sim_pars()
