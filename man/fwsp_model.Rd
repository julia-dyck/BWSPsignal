\title{Fit frequentist model to time-to-event data}
\usage{
fwsp_model(dat, tte.dist = c("w", "dw", "pgw"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame or matrix with time information in first column and
event information (binary status) in second column}

\item{tte.dist}{character specifying the distribution for the
model; options are \code{"w", "dw", "pgw"} (see details)}
}
\value{
Output of the fitted model. For \code{"w"}, a \code{summary.survreg} object;
for \code{"dw"}, a list of two \code{summary.survreg} objects
with \code{$uncens} containing the ML estimate
obtained from the model to the tte data as is, and \code{$cens} containing the
ML estimate obtained from the model fitted to the tte data censored at mid of observation period;
for \code{pgw}, a list containing the maximum likelihood estimate
(log of all parameters) obtained from \code{\link[stats]{nlm}}.
}
\description{
Fits a frequentist model to time-to-event (tte) data via maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation.
}
\details{
The model can be a Weibull \code{("w")},
a double Weibull (estimating two Weibull models - one to the data as is and
one to the data censored at mid of observation period),
or a power generalized Weibull \code{("pgw")} model.

The likelihood used in ML estimation is
\deqn{\mathcal{L}(t) = \prod_{i=1}^N S(t_i)^{1-d_i}\cdot f(t_i)^{d_i}}
with \eqn{S(t)} the survival function of the chosen distribution and \eqn{f(t)} the
density function \insertCite{nikulin2016}{BWSPsignal}. The pair \eqn{(t_i, d_i)} are the tte observations.

Since the \code{survreg} function from the \code{survival} package uses a different parametrization,
the parameters transformed to the parametrization used in \link{\code[stats]{rweibull}}
and \link{\code{rpgw}} are printed after function call.
